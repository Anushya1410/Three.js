# This is a placeholder file. In a real implementation, you would:
# 1. Download a free GLTF/GLB model from Sketchfab, Poly Pizza, or similar
# 2. Place the actual .glb file here
# 3. The model should be optimized for web (< 10MB recommended)
# 4. Common headphone models available on these platforms include:
#    - Sony WH-1000XM series style headphones
#    - Apple AirPods Max style headphones  
#    - Generic over-ear headphone models
# 
# For now, the 3D viewer component will handle the missing model gracefully
# and show a loading state or fallback visualization.
